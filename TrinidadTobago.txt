General information

The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to
inform the pre-travel consultation. For advice regarding safety and security
please check the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website.
Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their health professional
at least four to six weeks before travel. However, even if time is short, an
appointment is still worthwhile. This appointment provides an opportunity to
assess health risks taking into account a number of factors including
destination, medical history, and planned activities. For those with pre-
existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended.
While most travellers have a healthy and safe trip, there are some risks that
are relevant to travellers regardless of destination. These may for example
include road traffic and other accidents, diseases transmitted by insects or
ticks, diseases transmitted by contaminated food and water, sexually
transmitted infections, or health issues related to the heat or cold.
All travellers should ensure they have adequate_travel_health_insurance.
A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of
certain health problems is available below.

Vaccine recommendations

Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below.

All Travellers

Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters
as recommended_in_the_UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine.
Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work,
lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date
with additional recommended vaccines. See the individual chapters of the ‘Green
Book’ Immunisation_against_infectious_disease for further details.

Certificate Requirements

Please read the information below carefully, as certificate requirements may
be relevant to certain travellers only. For travellers further details, if
required, should be sought from their healthcare professional.

* There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in parts of this country (see
  ‘Some Travellers’ section below).
* Under International Health Regulations (2005), a yellow fever vaccination
  certificate is required for travellers over 1 year of age arriving from
  countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers having
  transited through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever
  transmission.
* For this country, the yellow fever vaccination certificate is valid for 10
  years until further notice.
* View_the_WHO_list_of_countries_with_risk_of_yellow_fever_transmission


Most Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for most travellers visiting this
country. Information on these vaccines can be found by clicking on the blue
arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Tetanus
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani and occurs
worldwide.  Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure and may be
introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn or scratch.

Prevention

Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate medical
attention.

Tetanus vaccination


* Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according to
  the UK schedule.
* If travelling to a country where medical facilities may be limited, a booster
  dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine is recommended if the last dose was more
  than ten years ago even if five doses of vaccine have been given previously.

Country specific information on medical facilities may be found in the ‘health’
section of the FCO_foreign_travel_advice website.

Some Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for some travellers visiting this
country. Information on when these vaccines should be considered can be found
by clicking on the arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through contaminated food and
water or by direct contact with an infectious person. Symptoms are often mild
or absent in young children, but the disease becomes more serious with
advancing age. Recovery can vary from weeks to months. Following hepatitis A
illness immunity is lifelong.
Those at increased risk include travellers visiting friends and relatives,
long-stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor sanitation.

Prevention

All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.

Hepatitis A vaccination

Vaccination is recommended for those whose activities put them at increased
risk. This includes:

* those who are staying with or visiting the local population
* frequent and/or long-stay travellers to areas where sanitation and food
  hygiene are likely to be poor
* those with existing medical conditions such as liver disease or haemophilia
* men who have sex with men
* injecting drug users
* those who may be exposed to the virus through their work
* those going to areas of hepatitis A outbreaks who have limited access to safe
  water and medical care

Hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting protection;
it could be considered for previously unvaccinated travellers at the discretion
of their healthcare provider.
Hepatitis_A_in_brief
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a viral infection; it is transmitted by exposure to infected
blood or body fluids. This mostly occurs during sexual contact or as a result
of blood-to-blood contact (for example from contaminated equipment during
medical and dental procedures, tattooing or body piercing procedures, and
sharing of intravenous needles). Mothers with the virus can also transmit the
infection to their baby during childbirth.

Hepatitis B in Trinidad and Tobago

2% or more of the population are known or thought to be persistently infected
with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high prevalence).

Prevention

Travellers should avoid contact with blood or body fluids. This includes:

* avoiding unprotected sexual intercourse.
* avoiding tattooing, piercing, public shaving, and acupuncture (unless sterile
  equipment is used).
* not sharing needles or other injection equipment.
* following universal precautions if working in a medical/dental/high risk
  setting.

A sterile medical equipment kit may be helpful when travelling to resource poor
areas.

Hepatitis B vaccination

Vaccination could be considered for all travellers, and is recommended for
those whose activities or medical history put them at increased risk including:

* those who may have unprotected sex.
* those who may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use.
* those who may be exposed to blood or body fluids through their work (e.g.
  health workers).
* those who may be exposed to contaminated needles as a result of having
  medical or dental care e.g. those with pre-existing medical conditions and
  those travelling for medical care abroad including those intending to receive
  renal dialysis overseas.
* long-stay travellers
* those who are participating in contact sports.
* families adopting children from this country.

Hepatitis_B_in_brief
Rabies
Rabies is a viral infection which is usually transmitted following contact with
the saliva of an infected animal most often via a bite, scratch or lick to an
open wound or mucous membrane (such as on the eye, nose or mouth). Although
many different animals can transmit the virus, worldwide most cases follow a
bite or scratch from an infected dog. Bats are also an important source of
infection in some countries.
Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do the condition
is almost always fatal.
The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see
below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.

Rabies in Trinidad and Tobago

Rabies has only been reported in wild animals in this country; therefore most
travellers are considered to be at low risk for rabies. Bats may also carry
rabies-like viruses in this country.

Prevention


* Travellers should avoid contact with wild animals.  Rabies is preventable
  with prompt post-exposure treatment.
* Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an
  urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial.
  Although rabies has not been reported in domestic animals, it is still
  sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched by all animals.
* Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national
  guidelines.


Rabies vaccination


* Pre-exposure vaccines are recommended for those who are at increased risk due
  to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the virus, those working
  with animals or health care workers who may be caring for infected patients).
* Pre-exposure vaccines could be considered for those who are at increased risk
  of exposure to wild animals.

 Rabies_in_brief
Yellow Fever
Yellow fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which predominantly
feed between dawn and dusk, but may also bite at night, especially in the
jungle environment. Symptoms may be absent or mild, but in severe cases, it can
cause internal bleeding, organ failure and death.

Yellow fever in Trinidad and Tobago

There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in parts of this country,  see
below.

Prevention

Travellers should avoid mosquito bites at all times.

Yellow fever vaccination


* Vaccination is recommended for travellers aged 9 months and older travelling
  to the island of Trinidad, except as mentioned below.
* Vaccination is generally not recommended for travellers whose itineraries are
  limited to the urban areas of the capital city of Port of Spain, cruise ship
  passengers who do not disembark from the ship and aeroplane passengers in
  transit, but could be considered for a small subset of travellers to such
  areas who are at increased risk because of:
  – Prolonged travel
  – Heavy exposure to mosquito bites
  – Inability to avoid insect bites.
* Vaccination is not recommended for travellers whose itineraries are limited
  to the island of Tobago
* See vaccine recommendation map below

The yellow fever vaccine is not suitable for all travellers, there are specific
undesirable effects associated with it. This vaccine is only available at
registered_yellow_fever_vaccination_centres. Health professionals should
carefully assess the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and seek specialist
advice if necessary.

Yellow fever vaccine recommendations in the Americas

Map_provided_by_the_Travelers’_Health_Branch,_Centers_for_Disease_Control_and
Prevention
_YF-map-Americas_
Current as of September 2014. This map, which aligns with recommendations also
published by the World Health Organization (WHO), is an updated version of the
2010 map created by the Informal WHO Working Group on the Geographic Risk of
Yellow Fever.
1. Yellow fever (YF) vaccination is generally not recommended in areas where
there is low potential for YF virus exposure. However, vaccination might be
considered for a small subset of travelers to these areas who are at increased
risk for exposure to YF virus because of prolonged travel, heavy exposure to
mosquitoes, or inability to avoid mosquito bites. Consideration for vaccination
of any traveler must take into account the traveler’s risk of being infected
with YF virus, country entry requirements, and individual risk factors for
serious vaccine-associated adverse events (e.g. age, immune status).

Other risks

The risk below may be present in all or part of the country.

Dengue

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which predominantly feed
between dawn and dusk.  It causes a flu-like illness, which can occasionally
develop into a more serious life-threatening form of the disease. Severe dengue
is rare in travellers.
The mosquitoes that transmit dengue are most abundant in towns, cities and
surrounding areas. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk. 

Dengue in Trinidad and Tobago

Dengue is known or has the potential to occur in this country.

Prevention


* All travellers should avoid mosquito bites particularly between dawn and
  dusk.
* There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.

Dengue_in_brief

Zika Virus

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which
predominantly feed between dawn and dusk. A small number of cases of sexual
transmission of ZIKV have also been reported. Most people infected with ZIKV
have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur they are usually mild and, short-
lived. Serious complications and deaths are not common, however, an increase in
congenital anomalies (birth defects), neurological and autoimmune syndromes
have recently been reported in areas where ZIKV outbreaks have occurred.
Possible links to ZIKV infection are being investigated.

Zika virus in Trinidad and Tobago

This country has reported locally acquired cases of ZIKV in the last 2 months
(so is considered to have current active ZIKV transmission). Sporadic
transmission following recent introduction has been reported. Details of
specific affected areas within this country are not available.

Prevention


* All travellers should avoid mosquito bites particularly between dawn and
  dusk.
* There is no vaccination or medication to prevent ZIKV infection.
* It is recommended that pregnant women planning to travel to areas with active
  ZIKV transmission should postpone non-essential travel until after pregnancy.
* Women should avoid becoming pregnant while travelling in, and for 28 days
  after leaving an area with active ZIKV transmission.
* If a woman develops symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection, it is
  recommended she avoids becoming pregnant for a further 28 days following.
* Pregnant women who visited this country while pregnant, or who become
  pregnant within 28 days of leaving this country, should contact their GP,
  obstetrician or midwife for further advice, even if they have not been
  unwell. Further_information_about_when_to_perform_fetal_ultrasound_scanning,
  and,_if_necessary,_referral_to_the_local_fetal_medicine_service_is_available.


Preventing sexual transmission


* Almost all cases of ZIKV are acquired via mosquito bites. A small number of
  cases of sexual transmission of ZIKV have been reported, although reports are
  increasing, the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV is thought to be very
  low.
