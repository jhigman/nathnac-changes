General information

The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to
inform the pre-travel consultation. For advice regarding safety and security
please check the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website.
Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their health professional
at least four to six weeks before travel. However, even if time is short, an
appointment is still worthwhile. This appointment provides an opportunity to
assess health risks taking into account a number of factors including
destination, medical history, and planned activities. For those with pre-
existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended.
While most travellers have a healthy and safe trip, there are some risks that
are relevant to travellers regardless of destination. These may for example
include road traffic and other accidents, diseases transmitted by insects or
ticks, diseases transmitted by contaminated food and water, sexually
transmitted infections, or health issues related to the heat or cold.
All travellers should ensure they have adequate_travel_health_insurance.  If
visiting European Economic Area (EEA) countries carry an European_health
insurance_card_(EHIC) as this will allow access to state-provided healthcare in
EEA countries, at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free. The EHIC, however, is
not an alternative to travel insurance.
A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of
certain health problems is available below.

Vaccine recommendations

Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below.

All Travellers

Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters
as recommended_in_the_UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine.
Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work,
lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date
with additional recommended vaccines. See the individual chapters of the ‘Green
Book’ Immunisation_against_infectious_disease for further details.

Certificate Requirements

There are no certificate requirements under International Health Regulations
(2005).

Most Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for most travellers visiting this
country. Information on these vaccines can be found by clicking on the blue
arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Tetanus
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani and occurs
worldwide.  Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure and may be
introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn or scratch.
Prevention
Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate medical
attention.

Tetanus vaccination


* Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according to
  the UK schedule.
* If travelling to a country where medical facilities may be limited, a booster
  dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine is recommended if the last dose was more
  than ten years ago even if five doses of vaccine have been given previously.

Country specific information on medical facilities may be found in the ‘health’
section of the FCO_foreign_travel_advice website.

Some Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for some travellers visiting this
country. Information on when these vaccines should be considered can be found
by clicking on the arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Rabies (Bat Lyssavirus)
Although rare, bat lyssaviruses (bat rabies) can be transmitted to humans or
other animals following contact with the saliva of an infected bat most often
by a bite. The disease can also be transmitted if the saliva of an infected bat
gets into open wounds or mucous membranes (such as on the eye, nose or mouth).
Bat lyssaviruses can cause disease in humans that is indistinguishable from
rabies.
Symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do the condition is
almost always fatal.
The risk to most travellers is low. However, it is increased for certain
occupations for example bat handlers and veterinarians, or certain activities
such as caving.

Bat Lyssavirus in Norway

Rabies has not been reported in domestic or wild animals in this country;
therefore most travellers are considered to be at low risk. However, bats may
carry bat lyssavirus (bat rabies).

Prevention


* Travellers should avoid contact with bats. Bites from bats are frequently
  unrecognised. Rabies-like disease caused by bat lyssaviruses is preventable
  with prompt post-exposure rabies treatment.
* Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an
  urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial.
  Although rabies has not been reported in other animals in this country, it is
  sensible to seek prompt medical advice if bitten or scratched. It is
  possible, although very rare for bats to pass rabies like viruses to other
  animals including pets.
* Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national
  guidelines.


Rabies vaccination


* Pre-exposure rabies vaccinations are recommended for those who are at
  increased risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the
  virus and those working with bats).
* Pre exposure vaccines could be considered for those whose activities put them
  at increased risk of exposure to bats.

 Rabies_in_brief
Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE)
TBE is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of infected ticks. Less
commonly, cases of TBE occur following ingestion of unpasteurised milk
products.
Travellers are at increased risk of exposure during outdoor activities in areas
of vegetation (gardens, parks, forest fringes and meadows typically below 1,500
metres). Ticks are most active between spring and autumn
Tick-borne encephalitis in Norway
There is a risk of TBE in some areas of Norway.  The areas affected are along
the southern coast:

* Aust-Agder: Risør Tvedestrand, Arendal, Grimstad and Lillesand
* Vest-Agder: Kristiansand, Søgne, Mandal, Lindesnes, Lyngdal, Farsund og
  Flekkefjord
* Telemark: Kragerø, Bamble, Porsgrunn
* Vestfold: Larvik, Sandefjord

The transmission season varies, however, ticks are most active during early
spring to late autumn (March to November).

Prevention

* All travellers should avoid tick bites during outdoor activities.
* Travellers should check their skin regularly for ticks and remove them as
  soon as possible with a recommended_technique.
* Travellers should not eat or drink unpasteurised milk products.


Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination

Vaccination is recommended for those visiting affected areas whose activities
put them at increased risk including:

* Those who will be going to live in TBE risk areas
* Those working in forestry, woodcutting, farming and the military
* Travellers to forested areas typically during spring to late autumn e.g.
  campers, hikers, hunters and individuals who undertake fieldwork
* Laboratory workers who may be exposed to TBE
