General information

The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to
inform the pre-travel consultation.
Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their GP practice or
travel clinic at least four to six weeks before travel. This appointment
provides an opportunity to assess health risks taking into account a number of
factors including destination, medical history, and planned activities. For
those with pre-existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended.
However, even if time is short, an appointment is still worthwhile.
While most travellers have a healthy and safe trip, there are some risks that
are relevant to all travellers. These include road traffic and other accidents,
sexually transmitted infections, diseases transmitted by insects or ticks,
diseases transmitted by contaminated food and water, and extremes of
temperature.
All travellers should ensure they have adequate_travel_health_insurance.
A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of
certain health problems is available below.

Vaccine recommendations

Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below.

All Travellers

Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters
as recommended_in_the_UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine.
Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work,
lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date
with additional recommended vaccines. See the individual chapters of the ‘Green
Book’ Immunisation_against_infectious_disease for further details.

Certificate Requirements

There are no certificate requirements under International Health Regulations
(2005).

Most Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for most travellers visiting this
country. Information on these vaccines can be found by clicking on the blue
arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through contaminated food and
water or by direct contact with an infectious person. Symptoms are often mild
or absent in young children, but the disease becomes more serious with
advancing age.  Recovery can vary from weeks to months. Following hepatitis A
illness immunity is lifelong.
Those at increased risk include travellers visiting friends and relatives,
long-stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor sanitation.

Prevention

All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.

Hepatitis A vaccination

As hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting protection,
it is recommended for all previously unvaccinated travellers.
Hepatitis_A_in_brief
Tetanus
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani and occurs
worldwide.  Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure and may be
introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn or scratch.

Prevention

Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate medical
attention.

Tetanus vaccination


* Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according to
  the UK schedule.
* If travelling to a country where medical facilities may be limited, a booster
  dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine is recommended if the last dose was more
  than ten years ago even if five doses of vaccine have been given previously.

Country specific information on medical facilities may be found in the ‘health’
section of the FCO_foreign_travel_advice website.

Some Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for some travellers visiting this
country. Information on when these vaccines should be considered can be found
by clicking on the arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Cholera
Cholera is a bacterial infection transmitted by contaminated food and water.
Cholera can cause severe watery diarrhoea although mild infections are common.
Most travellers are at low risk.

Prevention

All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.

Cholera vaccination

This oral vaccine is recommended for those whose activities or medical history
put them at increased risk.  This includes:

* aid workers
* those going to areas of cholera outbreaks who have limited access to safe
  water and medical care.
* those for whom vaccination is considered potentially beneficial.

Cholera_in_brief
Typhoid
Typhoid is a bacterial infection transmitted through contaminated food and
water.  Previous typhoid illness may only partially protect against re-
infection.
Travellers who will have access to safe food and water are likely to be at low
risk. Those at increased risk include travellers visiting friends and
relatives, frequent or long-stay travellers to areas where sanitation and food
hygiene are likely to be poor.

Typhoid in Mexico

Typhoid fever is known or presumed to occur in this country.

Prevention

All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.

Typhoid vaccination


* Both oral and injectable typhoid vaccinations are available, and vaccination
  is recommended for laboratory personnel who may handle the bacteria for their
  work.
* Vaccination could be considered for those whose activities put them at
  increased risk (see above).

Typhoid_in_brief
Rabies
Rabies is a viral infection which is usually transmitted following contact with
the saliva of an infected animal most often via a bite, scratch or lick to an
open wound or mucous membrane (such as on the eye, nose or mouth). Although
many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or
scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important
source of infection.
Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition
is almost always fatal.
The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see
below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.

Rabies in Mexico

Rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals in this country. Bats may
also carry rabies-like viruses.

Prevention


* Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with
  prompt post-exposure treatment.
* Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an
  urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial.
* Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national
  guidelines.


Rabies vaccination

Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put
them at increased risk including:

* those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the
  virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for
  infected patients).
* those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical
  care is limited.
* those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling.
* long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Malaria

Malaria is a serious illness caused by infection of red blood cells with a
parasite called Plasmodium. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes which
predominantly feed between dusk and dawn.
Symptoms usually begin with a fever (high temperature) of 38°C (100°F) or more.
Other symptoms may include feeling cold and shivery, headache, nausea, vomiting
and aching muscles. Symptoms may appear between eight days and one year after
the infected mosquito bite.
Prompt diagnosis and treatment is required as people with malaria can
deteriorate quickly. Those at higher risk of malaria, or of severe
complications from malaria, include pregnant women, infants and young children,
the elderly, travellers who do not have a functioning spleen and those visiting
friends and relatives.

Prevention

Travellers should follow an ABCD guide to preventing malaria:
Awareness of the risk – Risk depends on the specific location, season of
travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation.
Bite prevention – Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures.
Chemoprophylaxis – Travellers should take antimalarials (malaria prevention
tablets) if appropriate for the area (see below). No antimalarials are 100%
effective but taking them in combination with mosquito bite avoidance measures
will give substantial protection against malaria.
Diagnosis – Travellers who develop a fever of 38°C [100°F] or higher more than
one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any symptoms
suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek immediate medical
care. Emergency standby treatment may be considered for those going to remote
areas with limited access to medical attention.

Risk Areas


* There is a low risk of malaria in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas in
  southern Mexico: chloroquine recommended.
* There is a very low risk of malaria in the states of Chihuahua, Durango,
  Nayarit, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa and the rest of Mexico:awareness of risk
  andbite avoidance recommended.


Antimalarial Recommendations Map

_Mexico-malaria-map_

Recommended Antimalarials

The recommended antimalarials for Mexico are listed below. They are recommended
for certain areas only (see description of risk areas above). If these are not
suitable please seek further specialist advice.
Please note, the advice for children is different, the dose is based on body
weight and some antimalarials are not suitable.
Chloroquine
Chloroquine 310mg:

* take  weekly
* start one week before you arrive in the malaria risk area and weekly for four
  weeks after leaving the malaria risk area
* take as prescribed
* for children the dose is based on the body weight (see table below)

Other risks

The risks below may be present in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically.

Altitude

There is a risk of altitude illness when travelling to destinations of 2,500
metres (8,200 feet) or higher. Important risk factors are the altitude gained,
rate of ascent and sleeping altitude. Rapid ascent without a period of
acclimatisation puts a traveller at increased risk.
There are three syndromes; acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude
cerebral oedema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE). HACE and HAPE
require immediate descent and medical treatment.

Altitude illness in Mexico

There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres. Some
example places of interest: Popocatepetl 5,452m and Mexico city 2,350m.

Prevention


* Travellers should spend a few days at an altitude below 3,000m.
* Where possible travellers should avoid travel from altitudes less than 1,200m
  to altitudes greater than 3,500m in a single day.
* Ascent above 3,000m should be gradual. Travellers should avoid increasing
  sleeping elevation by more than 500m per day and ensure a rest day (at the
  same altitude) every three or four days.
* Acetazolamide can be used to assist with acclimatisation, but should not
  replace gradual ascent.
* Travellers who develop symptoms of AMS (headache, fatigue, loss of appetite,
  nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further ascent. In the absence of
  improvement or with progression of symptoms the first response should be to
  descend.
* Development of HACE or HAPE symptoms requires immediate descent and emergency
  medical treatment.

Altitude_illness_in_brief

Dengue

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which predominantly feed
between dawn and dusk.  It causes a flu-like illness, which can occasionally
develop into a more serious life-threatening form of the disease. Severe dengue
is rare in travellers.
The mosquitoes that transmit dengue are most abundant in towns, cities and
surrounding areas. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk.

Dengue in Mexico

Dengue is known or has the potential to occur in this country.

Prevention


* All travellers should avoid mosquito bites particularly between dawn and
  dusk.
* There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.

Dengue_in_brief

Zika Virus

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which
predominantly feed between dawn and dusk. A small number of cases of sexual
transmission of ZIKV have also been reported. Most people infected with ZIKV
have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur they are usually mild and, short-
lived. Serious complications and deaths are not common, however, an increase in
congenital anomalies (birth defects), neurological and autoimmune syndromes
have recently been reported in areas where ZIKV outbreaks have occurred.
Possible links to ZIKV infection are being investigated.

Zika virus in Mexico

This country has reported locally acquired cases of ZIKV in the last 2 months
(so is considered to have current active ZIKV transmission). Increasing or
widespread transmission has been reported. Details of specific affected areas
within this country are not available, but the mosquitoes that transmit ZIKV
are unlikely to be found above 2,000m altitude.
The map below shows areas which are above 2,000m and can be used by travellers
and health professionals as a general guide to indicate potentially lower risk
areas for mosquito-acquired ZIKV infection. Travellers whose itineraries are
limited to areas above 2,000m are at a lower risk of acquiring ZIKV from a
mosquito; however there may still be a risk of sexual transmission.
Map_provided_by_the_Travelers’_Health_Branch,_Centers_for_Disease_Control_and
Prevention
_zika-map-mexico_
The categories shown on this map are intended as a general guideline and should
not be considered to indicate absolute risk. Elevation may vary within an area
to a larger extent than this map can depict. The presence of mosquitoes may
change seasonally, with increasing temperatures or rainfall, and may change
over time. Travellers to destinations that cross or are near an elevation
border may wish to consider the destination as an area of lower elevation.
Travellers to high elevations are still at risk of getting Zika from sex.

Prevention


* All travellers should avoid mosquito bites particularly between dawn and
  dusk.
* There is no vaccination or medication to prevent ZIKV infection.
* It is recommended that pregnant women planning to travel to areas with active
  ZIKV transmission should postpone non-essential travel until after pregnancy.
* Women should avoid becoming pregnant while travelling in, and for 28 days
  after leaving an area with active ZIKV transmission.
* If a woman develops symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection, it is
  recommended she avoids becoming pregnant for a further 28 days following.
* Pregnant women who visited this country while pregnant, or who become
  pregnant within 28 days of leaving this country, should contact their GP,
  obstetrician or midwife for further advice, even if they have not been
  unwell. Further_information_about_when_to_perform_fetal_ultrasound_scanning,
  and,_if_necessary,_referral_to_the_local_fetal_medicine_service_is_available.


Preventing sexual transmission


* Almost all cases of ZIKV are acquired via mosquito bites. A small number of
  cases of sexual transmission of ZIKV have been reported, although reports are
  increasing, the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV is thought to be low.
