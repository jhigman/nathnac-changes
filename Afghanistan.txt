Administration of yellow fever vaccine should take into account both the
certificate requirements under International Health Regulations and the risk of
yellow fever at the destination. The lack of a certificate requirement does not
necessarily indicate that there is no risk of disease.
YELLOW FEVER
Yellow fever is a systemic viral disease.
** Risk assessment **
    * There is no risk of yellow fever in this country, however, there is a
      certificate requirement.
** Certificate requirements **
    * Under International Health Regulations (2005), a yellow fever vaccination
      certificate is required from travellers arriving from countries with risk
      of yellow fever transmission.

not had a polio vaccine booster in the last 10 years should receive a polio
vaccine before travel.
The following additional Public Health England and NaTHNaC advice should also
be followed until further notice
    * Travellers to settings with extremely poor hygiene (e.g. refugee camps),
      or likely to be in close proximity with cases (e.g. healthcare workers),
      and/or visiting for six months or more, are advised to have a booster
      dose of polio-containing vaccine if they had not received vaccination in
      the past 12 months.
    * Travellers are encouraged to carry documentary evidence of their polio
      vaccination status (an International Certificate of Vaccination or
      Prophylaxis is NOT required by this country).
    * Further information relating to this advice is availablehere.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals.
      Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure is increased by the type of activity (e.g. running,
      cycling), occupation (e.g. veterinarians) and for those staying in this
      country for long periods.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with all animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
 
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulins may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TUBERCULOSIS ***
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A map
showing the global areas at risk for tuberculosis can be found here_(will_open
in_new_window).
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - The average annual incidence of TB from 2010 to 2012 was greater than
      or equal to 40 cases per 100,000 population.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - TB is transmitted following inhalation of
      infectious respiratory droplets. Most travellers are at low risk.
      Travellers at higher risk include healthcare workers, those who are
      visiting friends and relatives (particularly young children), long stay
      travellers, and those who have close contact with an infected individual.
** Risk management **
    *  The pre-travel visit is an opportunity to ensure that individuals in
      defined risk categories are vaccinated with BCG according to current UK
      guidance.  For further details see the Department of Health Immunisation
      against infectious disease (The_Green_Book).
Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious
pulmonary TB.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative children from 6 to under 16 years of age, who are going to live for
more than 3 months in this country.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated children younger than 6 years
of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. These
children will usually not need a tuberculin skin test prior to vaccination.
Healthcare workers should take appropriate infection control precautions.  BCG
vaccine should be considered for previously unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative health care workers younger than 35 years of age. This recommendation
is irrespective of duration of stay.
There are specific contraindications and adverse events associated with BCG
vaccine. A careful risk assessment should be made before administration and
specialist advice sought as appropriate.
Travellers who are in the risk groups described and who do not receive BCG
vaccine should be considered for pre-travel and post-travel testing for
exposure to tuberculosis.
Travellers who suspect that they may have been exposed to tuberculosis should
receive an appropriate medical evaluation.

Malaria
Non-Vaccine Preventable Risks: Malaria | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** MALARIA ***
Malaria is a serious febrile illness caused by infection of red blood cells
with Plasmodium sp. parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P.
malariae. View_a_map_of_the_global_distribution_of_malaria_as_determined_by_the
World_Health_Organization_(WHO)_here. Malaria prevention advice for this
country follows Public Health England, Advisory_Committee_on_Malaria_Prevention
(ACMP)_guidelines.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      -
          o There is a risk of malaria in areas of Afghanistan below 2,000m
            between May and November. There is a low risk of malaria in this
            part of the country during the rest of the year.
          o There is low to no risk of malaria in areas above 2,000m.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Malaria is transmitted via the bite of an
      infected Anopheles mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during the hours from dusk to dawn.
** Risk management **
    * Awareness of risk - Risk depends on the specific location, season of
      travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation. Those at
      higher risk of malaria, or of severe complications from malaria, include
      pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly, and those
      visiting friends and relatives.
    * Bite prevention - Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance
      measures. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly during the hours from
      dusk to dawn.
    * Chemoprophylaxis - No malaria prevention tablets are 100% effective.
      Taking malaria prevention tablets in combination with mosquito bite
      avoidance measures will give substantial protection against malaria.
          o Chloroquine resistance is present. The recommended chemoprophylaxis
            for areas below 2,000m between May and November  is chloroquine
            plus proguanil. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for these areas
            during the rest of the year.
          o Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for areas above 2,000m .
    * Diagnosis - Travellers who develop a fever of 38°C [100°F] or higher more
      than one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any
      symptoms suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek
      immediate medical care.

*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.
