** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Hepatitis A is known or presumed to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis A is transmitted through contaminated
      food and water. Those at higher risk include travellers visiting friends
      and relatives, long stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor
      sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions.
    * Vaccine should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should_receive
      vaccine to travellers whose planned activities put them at risk (see
      above).
    * Because hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting
      protection, it may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine
      for_those_in_risk_categories to all previously unvaccinated travellers.
    * Vaccine should also be given to those with chronic liver disease or
      haemophilia, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and those at
      occupational risk.

*** HEPATITIS B ***
Hepatitis B is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver and may
lead to chronic complications.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - In this country 2% or more of the population are known or presumed to
      be persistently infected with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high
      prevalence).
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis B is transmitted via infected blood or
      bodily fluids.
** Risk management **
    *  Travellers should avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids. Where
      contact is unavoidable, appropriate protective precautions should be
      taken.
A sterile medical kit should be carried.
Vaccination should be considered for all adult and child travellers.
Vaccination is recommended for travellers at higher risk of exposure including
those who:
      - may have unprotected sex
      - may be directly exposed to blood or blood products through their
     occupation, such as healthcare professionals
      - are participating in contact sports
      - may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use,
     or as a result of accessing medical or dental care e.g. those with
     pre-existing medical conditions and those travelling for medical care
      - intend to undergo renal dialysis whilst overseas
      - are adopting children from the country
      - long stay travellers.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies has not been reported in domestic or wild animals in this country
however, bats may carry rabies-like viruses.
 
** Risk assessment **
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Rabies transmission may occur following contact
      with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites, scratches or saliva
      contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised. The risk of exposure to bats may be increased for certain
      occupations e.g. veterinarians.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a bite, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent
      medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Prompt
      post-exposure treatmentis required, even if pre-exposure vaccine has been
      received.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in 
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulin may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TETANUS ***
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
    * A booster dose should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should
      receive_vaccine to travellers whose last dose of a tetanus-containing
      vaccine was given more than 10 years ago, and who will not have ready
      access to medical care; even if they have received five doses previously.

*** TYPHOID ***
Typhoid fever is a systemic disease caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Typhoid fever is known or presumed to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Typhoid is transmitted through contaminated food
      and water. Travellers who will have access to safe food and water are
      likely to be at low risk. Those at higher risk include travellers
      visiting friends and relatives, young children, long-term travellers, and
      those visiting areas of poor sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions even if vaccinated.
    * Most travellers are at low risk and do not need vaccination.
    * Vaccine may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine_for
      those_in_risk_categories to travellers whose planned activities put them
      at higher risk (see above). Current vaccines against SalmonellaTyphi are
      only 50-80% protective and do not protect against SalmonellaParatyphi.
      Previous typhoid illness does not confer reliable immunity.

*** DENGUE FEVER ***
Dengue is a systemic viral disease. A_map_showing_the_global_areas_at_risk_for

** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Dengue is known or has the potential to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Dengue is transmitted via the bite of an infected
      Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during daylight hours and are most abundant in urban or peri-urban
      settings. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures. Aedes mosquitoes
      feed predominantly during daylight hours.
    * There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.
    * A previous dengue illness with one of the four dengue virus serotypes
      does not confer immunity to other virus serotypes.
    * Infection with a second dengue serotype may be a risk factor for the
      development of dengue haemorrhagic fever.
