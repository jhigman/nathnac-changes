*** HEPATITIS B ***
Hepatitis B is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver and may
lead to chronic complications.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - In this country 2% or more of the population are known or presumed to
      be persistently infected with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high
      prevalence).
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis B is transmitted via infected blood or
      bodily fluids.
** Risk management **
    *  Travellers should avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids. Where
      contact is unavoidable, appropriate protective precautions should be
      taken.
A sterile medical kit should be carried.
Vaccination should be considered for all adult and child travellers.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals.
      Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the salivaÂ of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure is increased by the type of activity (e.g. running,
      cycling), occupation (e.g. veterinarians) and for those staying in this
      country for long periods.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with all animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance withÂ PHE_guidelines.

*** TUBERCULOSIS ***
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A map
showing the global areas at risk for tuberculosis can be found here_(will_open
in_new_window).
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - The average annual incidence of TB from 2010 to 2012 was greater than
      or equal to 40 cases per 100,000 population.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - TB is transmitted following inhalation of
      infectious respiratory droplets. Most travellers are at low risk.
      Travellers at higher risk include healthcare workers, those who are
      visiting friends and relatives (particularly young children), long stay
      travellers, and those who have close contact with an infected individual.
** Risk management **
    *  The pre-travel visit is an opportunity to ensure that individuals in
      defined risk categories are vaccinated with BCG according to current UK
      guidance. Â For further details see the Department of Health Immunisation
      against infectious disease (The_Green_Book).
Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious
pulmonary TB.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative children from 6 to under 16 years of age, who are going to live for
more than 3 months in this country.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated children younger than 6 years
of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. These
children will usually not need a tuberculin skin test prior to vaccination.
Healthcare workers should take appropriate infection control precautions.Â  BCG
vaccine should be considered for previously unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative health care workers younger than 35 years of age. This recommendation
is irrespective of duration of stay.
There are specific contraindications and adverse events associated with BCG
vaccine. A careful risk assessment should be made before administration and
specialist advice sought as appropriate.
Travellers who are in the risk groups described and who do not receive BCG
vaccine should be considered for pre-travel and post-travel testing for
exposure to tuberculosis.
Travellers who suspect that they may have been exposed to tuberculosis should
receive an appropriate medical evaluation.

This section details infectious disease risks for which there are no vaccines
as well as some non-infectious disease risks. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further information about infectious and non-infectious disease risks can be
found on the NaTHNaC Health Information Sheets. Travellers should be aware that
accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.
Malaria
Non-Vaccine Preventable Risks: Malaria | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** MALARIA ***
Malaria is a serious febrile illness caused by infection of red blood cells
with Plasmodium sp. parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P.
malariae. View_a_map_of_the_global_distribution_of_malaria_as_determined_by_the
World_Health_Organization_(WHO)_here. Malaria prevention advice for this
country follows Public Health England,
Advisory_Committee_on_Malaria_Prevention_(ACMP)_guidelines.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      -
          o There is a high risk of malaria in the Amazon basin of Bolivia.
          o There is a risk of malaria in other rural areas below 2,500m.
          o There is no risk of malaria in areas above 2,500m.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Malaria is transmitted via the bite of an
      infected Anopheles mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during the hours from dusk to dawn.
** Risk management **
    * Awareness of risk - Risk depends on the specific location, season of
      travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation. Those at
      higher risk of malaria, or of severe complications from malaria, include
      pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly, and those
      visiting friends and relatives.
    * Bite prevention - Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance
      measures. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly during the hours from
      dusk to dawn.
    * Chemoprophylaxis - No malaria prevention tablets are 100% effective.
      Taking malaria prevention tablets in combination with mosquito bite
      avoidance measures will give substantial protection against malaria.
          o There is widespread chloroquine resistance in the Amazon basin. The
            recommended chemoprophylaxis for this area is mefloquine,
            doxycycline or atovaquone/proguanil.
          o The recommended chemoprophylaxis for other rural areas below 2,500m
            is chloroquine.
          o Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for areas above 2,500m.
    * Diagnosis - Travellers who develop a fever of 38Â°C [100Â°F] or higher more
      than one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any
      symptoms suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek
      immediate medical care.

The risks below may be a risk in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically:

Altitude, Dengue_fever
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.
