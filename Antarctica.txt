Rabies, Tetanus
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** RABIES ***
Rabies has not been reported in domestic or wild animals in this country
however, bats may carry rabies-like viruses.
 
** Risk assessment **
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Rabies transmission may occur following contact
      with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites, scratches or saliva
      contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised. The risk of exposure to bats may be increased for certain
      occupations e.g. veterinarians.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a bite, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent
      medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Prompt
      post-exposure treatmentis required, even if pre-exposure vaccine has been
      received.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in 
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulin may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TETANUS ***
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
    * A booster dose should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should
      receive_vaccine to travellers whose last dose of a tetanus-containing
      vaccine was given more than 10 years ago, and who will not have ready
      access to medical care; even if they have received five doses previously.

This section details infectious disease risks for which there are no vaccines
as well as some non-infectious disease risks. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further information about infectious and non-infectious disease risks can be
found on the NaTHNaC Health Information Sheets. Travellers should be aware that
accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.

The risks below may be a risk in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically:

Altitude
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.
