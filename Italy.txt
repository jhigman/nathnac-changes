*** HEPATITIS A ***
Hepatitis A is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver.A_map
showing_the_global_areas_at_risk_for_hepatitis_A_can_be_found_here_(102_KB_GIF)
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Hepatitis A is known to occur in this country although the risk to most
      travellers is considered to be low.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis A is transmitted through contaminated
      food and water. Travellers who will have access to safe food and water
      are at low risk. Those at higher risk include travellers visiting friends
      and relatives, long stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor
      sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions.
    * Vaccine may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine_for
      those_in_risk_categories to travellers whose planned activities put them
      at higher risk of exposure (see above).
    * Because hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting
      protection, it may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine
      for_those_in_risk_categories to all previously unvaccinated travellers.
    * Vaccine should also be given to those with chronic liver disease or
      haemophilia, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and those at
      occupational risk.

Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** RABIES ***
Rabies has not been reported in domestic or wild animals in this country
however, bats may carry rabies-like viruses.
 
** Risk assessment **
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Rabies transmission may occur following contact
      with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites, scratches or saliva
      contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised. The risk of exposure to bats may be increased for certain
      occupations e.g. veterinarians.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a bite, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an urgent
      medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial. Prompt
      post-exposure treatmentis required, even if pre-exposure vaccine has been
      received.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in 
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulin may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TETANUS ***
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
    * A booster dose should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should
      receive_vaccine to travellers whose last dose of a tetanus-containing
      vaccine was given more than 10 years ago, and who will not have ready
      access to medical care; even if they have received five doses previously.

*** TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS ***
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral disease affecting the central nervous
system.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - There is a low risk of TBE in some areas of the country below 1,400m. A
      small number of cases have been identified around the cites of Florence,
      Trento and Belluno, and the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. The
      transmission season varies, however, ticks are most active during early
      spring to late autumn (March to November).
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - TBE is transmitted to humans via the bite of an
      infected Ixodes tick. Travellers are at risk via exposure to ticks during
      outdoor activities in areas of vegetation (gardens, parks, forest
      fringes, meadows and marshes) below 1,400m. Cases of TBE may also occur
      following ingestion of unpasteurised milk products.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should take tick bite avoidance measures during outdoor
      activities.
    * Travellers should check themselves for ticks and be aware of effective
      tick_removal_methods.
    * Travellers should not eat or drink unpasteurised milk products.
    * TBE vaccine is not normally given to travellers to this country.

as well as some non-infectious disease risks. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further information about infectious and non-infectious disease risks can be
found on the NaTHNaC Health Information Sheets. Travellers should be aware that
accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.

The risks below may be a risk in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically:

Altitude
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.
