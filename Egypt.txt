    * Department_of_Health_Immunisation_Against_Infectious_Disease_(Green_book)
Yellow Fever
Vaccine Preventable Risks: Yellow_Fever | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
Administration of yellow fever vaccine should take into account both the
certificate requirements under International Health Regulations and the risk of
yellow fever at the destination. The lack of a certificate requirement does not
necessarily indicate that there is no risk of disease.
YELLOW FEVER
Yellow fever is a systemic viral disease.
** Risk assessment **
    * There is no risk of yellow fever in this country, however, there is a
      certificate requirement.
** Certificate requirements **
    * Under International Health Regulations (2005), a yellow fever vaccination
      certificate is required from travellers over 9 months of age arriving
      from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and for travellers
      having transited more than 12 hours through the airport of a country with
      risk of yellow fever transmission.
    * The certificate of yellow fever vaccination is valid for life.
    * View_the_WHO_list_of_countries_with_risk_of_yellow_fever_transmission.
    * All arrivals from Sudan are required to possess either a yellow fever
      vaccination certificate or a location certificate issued by a Sudanese
      official centre stating that they have not been in Sudan south of 15°N
      within the previous 6 days.

*** HEPATITIS B ***
Hepatitis B is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver and may
lead to chronic complications.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - In this country 2% or more of the population are known or presumed to
      be persistently infected with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high
      prevalence).
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis B is transmitted via infected blood or
      bodily fluids.
** Risk management **
    *  Travellers should avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids. Where
      contact is unavoidable, appropriate protective precautions should be
      taken.
A sterile medical kit should be carried.
Vaccination should be considered for all adult and child travellers.
Vaccination is recommended for travellers at higher risk of exposure including
those who:
      - may have unprotected sex
      - may be directly exposed to blood or blood products through their
     occupation, such as healthcare professionals
      - are participating in contact sports
      - may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use,
     or as a result of accessing medical or dental care e.g. those with
     pre-existing medical conditions and those travelling for medical care
      - intend to undergo renal dialysis whilst overseas
      - are adopting children from the country
      - long stay travellers.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals.
      Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure is increased by the type of activity (e.g. running,
      cycling), occupation (e.g. veterinarians) and for those staying in this
      country for long periods.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with all animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
 
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulins may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
    * A booster dose should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should

*** TYPHOID ***
Typhoid fever is a systemic disease caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Typhoid fever is known or presumed to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Typhoid is transmitted through contaminated food
      and water. Those at higher risk include travellers visiting friends and
      relatives, young children, long-term travellers, and those exposed to
      conditions of poor sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions even if vaccinated.
    * Vaccine should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should_receive
      vaccine to travellers whose planned activities put them at higher risk
      (see above). Current vaccines against SalmonellaTyphi are only 50-80%
      protective and do not protect against Salmonella Paratyphi. Previous
      typhoid illness does not confer reliable immunity.

This section details infectious disease risks for which there are no vaccines
as well as some non-infectious disease risks. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further information about infectious and non-infectious disease risks can be
found on the NaTHNaC Health Information Sheets. Travellers should be aware that
accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.
Malaria
Non-Vaccine Preventable Risks: Malaria | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** MALARIA ***
Cases of locally acquired malaria have been reported in Egypt in 2014 in the
Aswan Governorate (Clinical_Update,_as_of_19_June_2014). The risk of malaria
in Egypt is very low. Malaria is transmitted to humans by the bite of a
mosquito. Practising insect_bite_avoidance_measures will reduce the risk of
travellers acquiring a mosquito-borne disease. Travellers should be aware that
Anopheles spp mosquitoes bite during the evening and night. Chemoprophylaxis is
not recommended. Travellers who develop a fever of 38°C [100°F] or higher more
than one week after being in a malaria risk area, or within a year of return
should seek immediate medical care.
Additional Risks

The risks below may be a risk in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically:

Altitude,
Schistosomiasis
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.

*** SCHISTOSOMIASIS ***
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic flatworm infection of the intestinal or urinary
system caused by one of several species of Schistosoma.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - According to World Health Organization (WHO), cases of schistosomiasis
      were reported in this country in 2012. See_map.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Schistosoma larvae are released from infected
      freshwater snails and penetrate intact skin to establish infection
      (schistosomiasis). Travellers may be exposed to schistosoma during
      activities such as wading, swimming, bathing or washing clothes in fresh
      water streams, rivers or lakes. 
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid wading, swimming, or bathing in fresh water.
    * Swimming in chlorinated water or sea water is not a risk for
      schistosomiasis.
    * Topical application of insect repellent before exposure to water, or
      towel drying after accidental exposure to schistosomiasis are not
      reliable in preventing infection.
    * There is no vaccine or tablets to prevent schistosomiasis.
    * Travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a
      medical assessment.
