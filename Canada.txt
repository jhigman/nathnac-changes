*** HEPATITIS A ***
Hepatitis A is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver.A_map
showing_the_global_areas_at_risk_for_hepatitis_A_can_be_found_here_(102_KB_GIF)
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Hepatitis A is known to occur in this country although the risk to most
      travellers is considered to be low.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis A is transmitted through contaminated
      food and water. Travellers who will have access to safe food and water
      are at low risk. Those at higher risk include travellers visiting friends
      and relatives, long stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor
      sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions.
    * Vaccine may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine_for
      those_in_risk_categories to travellers whose planned activities put them
      at higher risk of exposure (see above).
    * Because hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting
      protection, it may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine
      for_those_in_risk_categories to all previously unvaccinated travellers.
    * Vaccine should also be given to those with chronic liver disease or
      haemophilia, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and those at
      occupational risk.

Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has only been reported in wild animals;
      therefore most travellers to this country are considered to be at low
      risk for rabies.
    * Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure to wild animals may be increased for those with
      certain occupations e.g. veterinarians and those undertaking certain
      trips e.g. camping, wildlife viewing.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with wild animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination could be considered for those at increased risk
      (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulins may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TETANUS ***
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
    * A booster dose should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should
      receive_vaccine to travellers whose last dose of a tetanus-containing
      vaccine was given more than 10 years ago, and who will not have ready
      access to medical care; even if they have received five doses previously.

as well as some non-infectious disease risks. This is not an exhaustive list.
Further information about infectious and non-infectious disease risks can be

accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.

The risks below may be a risk in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically:

Altitude
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.
