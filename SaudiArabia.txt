General information

The information on these pages should be used to research health risks and to
inform the pre-travel consultation. For advice regarding safety and security
please check the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website.
Travellers should ideally arrange an appointment with their health professional
at least four to six weeks before travel. However, even if time is short, an
appointment is still worthwhile. This appointment provides an opportunity to
assess health risks taking into account a number of factors including
destination, medical history, and planned activities. For those with pre-
existing health problems, an earlier appointment is recommended.
While most travellers have a healthy and safe trip, there are some risks that
are relevant to travellers regardless of destination. These may for example
include road traffic and other accidents, diseases transmitted by insects or
ticks, diseases transmitted by contaminated food and water, sexually
transmitted infections, or health issues related to the heat or cold.
All travellers should ensure they have adequate_travel_health_insurance.
A list of useful resources including advice on how to reduce the risk of
certain health problems is available below.

Vaccine recommendations

Details of vaccination recommendations and requirements are provided below.

All Travellers

Travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters
as recommended_in_the_UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine.
Those who may be at increased risk of an infectious disease due to their work,
lifestyle choice, or certain underlying health problems should be up to date
with additional recommended vaccines. See the individual chapters of the ‘Green
Book’ Immunisation_against_infectious_disease for further details.

Certificate requirements

Please read the information below carefully, as certificate requirements may
be relevant to certain travellers only. For travellers further details, if
required, should be sought from their healthcare professional.

Yellow Fever


* There isno risk of yellow fever in this country, however, there is a
  certificate requirement.
* Under International Health Regulations (2005), a yellow fever vaccination
  certificate is required from travellers over 1 year of age arriving from
  countries with risk of yellow fever transmission and from travellers having
  transited more than 12 hours through the airport of a country with risk of
  yellow fever transmission.
* This country considers the yellow fever vaccination certificate to be valid
  for life.
* View_the_WHO_list_of_countries_with_risk_of_yellow_fever_transmission.


Other Requirements

Meningococcal Disease
Proof of vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine (A, C, W, Y) is a visa
requirement for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims and seasonal workers (see ‘some
travellers’ section below).
Polio
Regardless of age and vaccination status, proof of receipt of a dose of oral
polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), within the
previous 12 months and at least 4 weeks before departure, is required for
travellers arriving from polio-endemic_countries to apply for an entry visa.

Most Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for most travellers visiting this
country. Information on these vaccines can be found by clicking on the blue
arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Tetanus
Tetanus is caused by a toxin released from Clostridium tetani and occurs
worldwide.  Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure and may be
introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn or scratch.

Prevention

Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate medical
attention.

Tetanus vaccination


* Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according to
  the UK schedule.
* If travelling to a country where medical facilities may be limited, a booster
  dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine is recommended if the last dose was more
  than ten years ago even if five doses of vaccine have been given previously.

Country specific information on medical facilities may be found in the ‘health’
section of the FCO_foreign_travel_advice website.

Some Travellers

The vaccines in this section are recommended for some travellers visiting this
country. Information on when these vaccines should be considered can be found
by clicking on the arrow. Vaccines are listed alphabetically.
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted through contaminated food and
water or by direct contact with an infectious person. Symptoms are often mild
or absent in young children, but the disease becomes more serious with
advancing age. Recovery can vary from weeks to months. Following hepatitis A
illness immunity is lifelong.
Those at increased risk include travellers visiting friends and relatives,
long-stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor sanitation.

Prevention

All travellers should take care with personal, food and water hygiene.

Hepatitis A vaccination

Vaccination is recommended for those whose activities put them at increased
risk. This includes:

* those who are staying with or visiting the local population
* frequent and/or long-stay travellers to areas where sanitation and food
  hygiene are likely to be poor
* those with existing medical conditions such as liver disease or haemophilia
* men who have sex with men
* injecting drug users
* those who may be exposed to the virus through their work
* those going to areas of hepatitis A outbreaks who have limited access to safe
  water and medical care

Hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting protection,
it could be considered for all previously unvaccinated travellers.
Hepatitis_A_in_brief
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a viral infection; it is transmitted by exposure to infected
blood or body fluids. This mostly occurs during sexual contact or as a result
of blood-to-blood contact (for example from contaminated equipment during
medical and dental procedures, tattooing or body piercing procedures, and
sharing of intravenous needles). Mothers with the virus can also transmit the
infection to their baby during childbirth.

Hepatitis B in Saudi Arabia

2% or more of the population are known or thought to be persistently infected
with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high prevalence).

Prevention

Travellers should avoid contact with blood or body fluids. This includes:

* avoiding unprotected sexual intercourse.
* avoiding tattooing, piercing, public shaving, and acupuncture (unless sterile
  equipment is used).
* not sharing needles or other injection equipment.
* following universal precautions if working in a medical/dental/high risk
  setting.

A sterile medical equipment kit may be helpful when travelling to resource poor
areas.

Hepatitis B vaccination

Vaccination could be considered for all travellers, and is recommended for
those whose activities or medical history put them at increased risk including:

* those who may have unprotected sex.
* those who may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use.
* those who may be exposed to blood or body fluids through their work (e.g.
  health workers).
* those who may be exposed to contaminated needles as a result of having
  medical or dental care e.g. those with pre-existing medical conditions and
  those travelling for medical care abroad including those intending to receive
  renal dialysis overseas.
* long-stay travellers
* those who are participating in contact sports.
* families adopting children from this country.

Hepatitis_B_in_brief
Meningococcal Disease
For Hajj and Umrah pilgrims and seasonal workers to this area, proof of
vaccination with a meningococcal ACWY vaccine is a visa requirement for entry.
Meningococcal disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by inhaling
respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions from an
infected person. This is usually following prolonged or frequent close contact.
The most common forms of meningococcal disease are meningococcal meningitis
(infection of the protective lining around the brain) and septicaemia (blood
poisoning).
Hajj and Umrah pilgrims and seasonal workers at the pilgrimages are at
increased risk due to the crowded conditions and possible close contact with
people from countries with higher rates of meningococcal disease.

Meningococcal disease in Saudi Arabia

Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis were reported in 1987, 2000 and 2001
during the Hajj.

Prevention

Travellers may reduce their risk by avoiding overcrowded situations where
possible.

Meningococcal disease vaccination

For pilgrims and seasonal workers proof of vaccination with a meningococcal
ACWY vaccine is a visa requirement for entry. This should be given at least 10
days before, and within the last 3 years of, planned travel. Details of the
vaccine given should be recorded in a patient held vaccine record showing the
traveller’s full name.
The meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine is recommended.

Rabies
Rabies is a viral infection which is usually transmitted following contact with
the saliva of an infected animal most often via a bite, scratch or lick to an
open wound or mucous membrane (such as on the eye, nose or mouth). Although
many different animals can transmit the virus, most cases follow a bite or
scratch from an infected dog. In some parts of the world, bats are an important
source of infection.
Rabies symptoms can take some time to develop, but when they do, the condition
is almost always fatal.
The risk of exposure is increased by certain activities and length of stay (see
below). Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.

Rabies in Saudi Arabia

Rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals in this country. Bats may
also carry rabies-like viruses.

Prevention


* Travellers should avoid contact with all animals. Rabies is preventable with
  prompt post-exposure treatment.
* Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and an
  urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears trivial.
* Post-exposure treatment and advice should be in accordance with national
  guidelines.


Rabies vaccination

Pre-exposure vaccinations are recommended for travellers whose activities put
them at increased risk including:

* those at risk due to their work (e.g. laboratory staff working with the
  virus, those working with animals or health workers who may be caring for
  infected patients).
* those travelling to areas where access to post-exposure treatment and medical
  care is limited.
* those planning higher risk activities such as running or cycling.
* long-stay travellers (more than one month).

Malaria

Malaria is a serious illness caused by infection of red blood cells with a
parasite called Plasmodium. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes which
predominantly feed between dusk and dawn.
Symptoms usually begin with a fever (high temperature) of 38°C (100°F) or more.
Other symptoms may include feeling cold and shivery, headache, nausea, vomiting
and aching muscles. Symptoms may appear between eight days and one year after
the infected mosquito bite.
Prompt diagnosis and treatment is required as people with malaria can
deteriorate quickly. Those at higher risk of malaria, or of severe
complications from malaria, include pregnant women, infants and young children,
the elderly, travellers who do not have a functioning spleen and those visiting
friends and relatives.

Prevention

Travellers should follow an ABCD guide to preventing malaria:
Awareness of the risk – Risk depends on the specific location, season of
travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation.
Bite prevention – Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures.
Chemoprophylaxis – Travellers should take antimalarials (malaria prevention
tablets) if appropriate for the area (see below). No antimalarials are 100%
effective but taking them in combination with mosquito bite avoidance measures
will give substantial protection against malaria.
Diagnosis – Travellers who develop a fever of 38°C [100°F] or higher more than
one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any symptoms
suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek immediate medical
care. Emergency standby treatment may be considered for those going to remote
areas with limited access to medical attention.

Risk Areas


* There is a risk of malaria in the south western provinces of Saudi Arabia,
  along the border with Yemen including Asir province below 2,000m: chloroquine
  plus proguanil recommended.
* There is no risk in the cities of Jeddah, Makkah (Mecca), Medina, Riyadh, and
  Ta’if, or in Asir province above 2,000m:bite avoidance only recommended.

Map coming soon

Recommended Antimalarials

The recommended antimalarials for Saudi Arabia are listed below.  They are
recommended for certain areas only (see  description of risk areas above).  If
these are not suitable please seek further specialist advice.
Please note, the advice for children is different, the dose is based on body
weight and some antimalarials are not suitable.
Chloroquine Plus Proguanil
Chloroquine 310mg and proguanil 200mg

* chloroquine and proguanil are two different drugs that work together to
  prevent malaria
* adults take chloroquine 310mg weekly and proguanil 200mg daily
* these antimalarials should be started one week before arrival in the malaria
  risk area and continued until four weeks after leaving the malaria risk area
* take as prescribed
* for children the dose is based on the body weight (see table below)

Other risks

The risks below may be present in all or part of the country and are presented
alphabetically.

Altitude

There is a risk of altitude illness when travelling to destinations of 2,500
metres (8,200 feet) or higher. Important risk factors are the altitude gained,
rate of ascent and sleeping altitude. Rapid ascent without a period of
acclimatisation puts a traveller at higher risk.
There are three syndromes; acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude
cerebral oedema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE). HACE and HAPE
require immediate descent and medical treatment.

Altitude illness in Saudi Arabia

There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres.

Prevention


* Travellers should spend a few days at an altitude below 3,000m.
* Where possible travellers should avoid travel from altitudes less than 1,200m
  to altitudes greater than 3,500m in a single day.
* Ascent above 3,000m should be gradual. Travellers should avoid increasing
  sleeping elevation by more than 500m per day and ensure a rest day (at the
  same altitude) every three or four days.
* Acetazolamide can be used to assist with acclimatisation, but should not
  replace gradual ascent.
* Travellers who develop symptoms of AMS (headache, fatigue, loss of appetite,
  nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further ascent. In the absence of
  improvement or with progression of symptoms the first response should be to
  descend.
* Development of HACE or HAPE symptoms requires immediate descent and emergency
  medical treatment.

Altitude_illness_in_brief

Dengue

Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes which predominantly feed
between dawn and dusk.  It causes a flu-like illness, which can occasionally
develop into a more serious life-threatening form of the disease. Severe dengue
is rare in travellers.
The mosquitoes that transmit dengue are most abundant in towns, cities and
surrounding areas. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk.

Dengue in Saudi Arabia

There is a risk of dengue in the provinces of: Al Madinah, Jizan and Makkah
(including the cities of Mecca and Jeddah).

Prevention


* All travellers should avoid mosquito bites particularly between dawn and
  dusk.
* There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.

Dengue_in_brief

Schistosomiasis

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection. Schistosoma larvae are released from
infected freshwater snails and can penetrate intact human skin following
contact with contaminated freshwater. Travellers may be exposed during
activities such as wading, swimming, bathing or washing clothes in freshwater
streams, rivers or lakes.
Schistosomiasis infection may cause no symptoms, but early symptoms can include
a rash and itchy skin (‘swimmer’s itch’), fever, chills, cough, or muscle
aches. If not treated, it can cause serious long term health problems such as
intestinal or bladder disease.

Schistosomiasis in Saudi Arabia

According to World Health Organization (WHO), cases of schistosomiasis were
reported in this country in 2012.

Prevention


* There is no vaccine or tablets to prevent schistosomiasis.
* All travellers should avoid wading, swimming, or bathing in freshwater where
  possible. Swimming in chlorinated water or sea water is not a risk for
  schistosomiasis.
* Topical application of insect repellent before exposure to water, or towel
  drying after accidental exposure to schistosomiasis are not reliable in
  preventing infection.
* All travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a
  medical assessment.
