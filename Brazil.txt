Yellow Fever
Vaccine Preventable Risks: Yellow_Fever | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
Administration of yellow fever vaccine should take into account both the
certificate requirements under International Health Regulations and the risk of
yellow fever at the destination. The lack of a certificate requirement does not
necessarily indicate that there is no risk of disease.
YELLOW FEVER
Yellow fever is a systemic viral disease.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - There is a risk of yellow fever transmission in the states of Acre,
      Amapá, Amazonas, Distrito Federal (including the capital city of
      Brasília), Goias, Maranhaõ, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas
      Gerais, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins, and designated areas in
      the states of Bahia, Paraná, Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina,
      and São Paulo (see below for Sao Paulo city).
    * There is no risk of yellow fever transmission in other areas of Brazil,
      including thecitiesof Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Sǎo
      Paulo.
    * Further information on the areas of Brazil with a risk of yellow fever
      transmission is available on the U.S_Centers_for_Disease_Control_and
      Prevention_(CDC)_website.
    * View_the_WHO_yellow_fever_vaccine_recommendation_map_for_Americas.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Yellow fever is transmitted via the bite of an
      infected Aedes mosquito (or other related species). Aedes mosquitoes feed
      predominantly during daylight hours.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures. Aedes mosquitoes
      feed predominantly during daylight hours.
    * Yellow fever vaccine should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories
      should_receive_vaccine to travellers 9 months of age and older travelling
      to the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Distrito Federal (including the
      capital city of Brasília), Goias, Maranhaõ, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do
      Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins, and designated
      areas in the states Bahia, Paraná, Piauí, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa
      Catarina and São Paulo. Vaccination is also recommended for travel to
      Iguaçu Falls.
    * Yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for travel only to coastal
      cities, including the cities of Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro,
      Salvador and Sǎo Paulo.
    * View_the_WHO_yellow_fever_vaccine_recommendation_map_for_Americas.
    * There are specific contraindications and adverse events associated with
      yellow fever vaccine. A careful risk assessment should be made before
      administration and specialist advice sought as appropriate.
** Certificate requirements **
    * Under International Health Regulations (2005), there are no yellow fever
      vaccination requirements for any traveller visiting this country.
      However, this does NOT mean that there is no risk of yellow fever
      infection.
    * See vaccine recommendations above to determine if vaccination against
      yellow fever is recommended for travel to this country.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals.
      Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure is increased by the type of activity (e.g. running,
      cycling), occupation (e.g. veterinarians) and for those staying in this
      country for long periods.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with all animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
 
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulins may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

*** TUBERCULOSIS ***
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A map
showing the global areas at risk for tuberculosis can be found here_(will_open
in_new_window).
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - The average annual incidence of TB from 2010 to 2012 was greater than
      or equal to 40 cases per 100,000 population.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - TB is transmitted following inhalation of
      infectious respiratory droplets. Most travellers are at low risk.
      Travellers at higher risk include healthcare workers, those who are
      visiting friends and relatives (particularly young children), long stay
      travellers, and those who have close contact with an infected individual.
** Risk management **
    *  The pre-travel visit is an opportunity to ensure that individuals in
      defined risk categories are vaccinated with BCG according to current UK
      guidance.  For further details see the Department of Health Immunisation
      against infectious disease (The_Green_Book).
Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious
pulmonary TB.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative children from 6 to under 16 years of age, who are going to live for
more than 3 months in this country.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated children younger than 6 years
of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. These
children will usually not need a tuberculin skin test prior to vaccination.
Healthcare workers should take appropriate infection control precautions.  BCG
vaccine should be considered for previously unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative health care workers younger than 35 years of age. This recommendation
is irrespective of duration of stay.
There are specific contraindications and adverse events associated with BCG
vaccine. A careful risk assessment should be made before administration and
specialist advice sought as appropriate.
Travellers who are in the risk groups described and who do not receive BCG
vaccine should be considered for pre-travel and post-travel testing for
exposure to tuberculosis.
Travellers who suspect that they may have been exposed to tuberculosis should
receive an appropriate medical evaluation.

*** TYPHOID ***
Typhoid fever is a systemic disease caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Typhoid fever is known or presumed to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Typhoid is transmitted through contaminated food
      and water. Travellers who will have access to safe food and water are
      likely to be at low risk. Those at higher risk include travellers
      visiting friends and relatives, young children, long-term travellers, and
      those visiting areas of poor sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions even if vaccinated.
    * Most travellers are at low risk and do not need vaccination.
    * Vaccine may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine_for
      those_in_risk_categories to travellers whose planned activities put them
      at higher risk (see above). Current vaccines against SalmonellaTyphi are
      only 50-80% protective and do not protect against SalmonellaParatyphi.
      Previous typhoid illness does not confer reliable immunity.

accidents and injuries are a cause of serious illness during travel.
Malaria
Non-Vaccine Preventable Risks: Malaria | Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** MALARIA ***
Malaria is a serious febrile illness caused by infection of red blood cells
with Plasmodium sp. parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P.
malariae. View_a_map_of_the_global_distribution_of_malaria_as_determined_by_the
World_Health_Organization_(WHO)_here. Malaria prevention advice for this
country follows Public Health England, Advisory_Committee_on_Malaria_Prevention
(ACMP)_guidelines.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      -
          o There is a risk of malaria in the Amazon basin of Brazil, including
            the city of Manaus.
          o There is a very low risk of malaria in the rest of Brazil.
          o There is no risk of malaria in Iguaçu Falls.
          o A_map_outlining_the_areas_where_malaria_prevention_tablets_
            (chemoprophylaxis)_should_be_taken_can_be_found_here
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Malaria is transmitted via the bite of an
      infected Anopheles mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during the hours from dusk to dawn.
** Risk management **
    * Awareness of risk - Risk depends on the specific location, season of
      travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation. Those at
      higher risk of malaria, or of severe complications from malaria, include
      pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly, and those
      visiting friends and relatives.
    * Bite prevention - Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance
      measures. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly during the hours from
      dusk to dawn.
    * Chemoprophylaxis - No malaria prevention tablets are 100% effective.
      Taking malaria prevention tablets in combination with mosquito bite
      avoidance measures will give substantial protection against malaria.
          o Chloroquine resistance is widespread in the Amazon basin. The
            recommended chemoprophylaxis for this area is mefloquine,
            doxycycline or atovaquone/proguanil.
          o Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for the rest of Brazil
            including Iguaçu Falls, however, travellers should be aware of the
            small risk of malaria.
    * Diagnosis - Travellers who develop a fever of 38°C [100°F] or higher more
      than one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any
      symptoms suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek
      immediate medical care.

Schistosomiasis
Additional_Risks | Back_to_Top
*** ALTITUDE ***
There is a point of elevation in this country higher than 2,500 metres (m).
** Risk assessment **
    * Travel to destinations of 2,500-3,500 m (8,200-11,500 feet) or higher
      carries the risk of altitude illness. Important risk factors for altitude
      illness are the altitude gained, rate of ascent and sleeping altitude.
      Rapid ascent without a period of acclimatisation puts a traveller at
      higher risk.
** Risk management **
    * The most important prevention measure is adequate acclimatisation.
    * Travellers should spend a few days at an intermediate altitude below
      3,000 m.
    * Ascent above 3,000 m should be gradual with no more than a 300 - 500 m
      increase in sleeping altitude per day, with a rest day every three days.
    * Acetazolamide is recognised for use in the prevention of altitude
      illness. It should not replace acclimatisation and gradual ascent.
    * Travellers who develop symptoms of altitude illness (headache, fatigue,
      loss of appetite, nausea and sleep disturbance) should avoid further
      ascent. In the absence of improvement or with progression of symptoms the
      first response should be to descend.
    * Development of more severe forms of altitude illness, high-altitude
      cerebral oedema (HACE) (confusion, difficulty with balance and
      coordination) or high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) (shortness of
      breath at rest, cough and chest tightness), require immediate descent and
      emergency medical treatment.

    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Dengue is known or has the potential to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Dengue is transmitted via the bite of an infected
      Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during daylight hours and are most abundant in urban or peri-urban
      settings. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures. Aedes mosquitoes
      feed predominantly during daylight hours.
    * There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.
    * A previous dengue illness with one of the four dengue virus serotypes
      does not confer immunity to other virus serotypes.
    * Infection with a second dengue serotype may be a risk factor for the
      development of dengue haemorrhagic fever.

*** SCHISTOSOMIASIS ***
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic flatworm infection of the intestinal or urinary
system caused by one of several species of Schistosoma.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - According to World Health Organization (WHO), cases of schistosomiasis
      were reported in this country in 2012. See_map.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Schistosoma larvae are released from infected
      freshwater snails and penetrate intact skin to establish infection
      (schistosomiasis). Travellers may be exposed to schistosoma during
      activities such as wading, swimming, bathing or washing clothes in fresh
      water streams, rivers or lakes. 
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid wading, swimming, or bathing in fresh water.
    * Swimming in chlorinated water or sea water is not a risk for
      schistosomiasis.
    * Topical application of insect repellent before exposure to water, or
      towel drying after accidental exposure to schistosomiasis are not
      reliable in preventing infection.
    * There is no vaccine or tablets to prevent schistosomiasis.
    * Travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a
      medical assessment.
