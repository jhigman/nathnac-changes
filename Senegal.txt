*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - in this country rabies has been reported in domestic and wild animals.
      Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the salivaÂ of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure is increased by the type of activity (e.g. running,
      cycling), occupation (e.g. veterinarians) and for those staying in this
      country for long periods.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with all animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for adults and children who
      are at increased risk (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance withÂ PHE_guidelines.

*** TUBERCULOSIS ***
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A map
showing the global areas at risk for tuberculosis can be found here_(will_open
in_new_window).
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - The average annual incidence of TB from 2010 to 2012 was greater than
      or equal to 40 cases per 100,000 population.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - TB is transmitted following inhalation of
      infectious respiratory droplets. Most travellers are at low risk.
      Travellers at higher risk include healthcare workers, those who are
      visiting friends and relatives (particularly young children), long stay
      travellers, and those who have close contact with an infected individual.
** Risk management **
    *  The pre-travel visit is an opportunity to ensure that individuals in
      defined risk categories are vaccinated with BCG according to current UK
      guidance. Â For further details see the Department of Health Immunisation
      against infectious disease (The_Green_Book).
Travellers should avoid close contact with individuals known to have infectious
pulmonary TB.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative children from 6 to under 16 years of age, who are going to live for
more than 3 months in this country.
BCG vaccine should be considered for unvaccinated children younger than 6 years
of age, who are going to live for more than 3 months in this country. These
children will usually not need a tuberculin skin test prior to vaccination.
Healthcare workers should take appropriate infection control precautions.Â  BCG
vaccine should be considered for previously unvaccinated, tuberculin skin test
negative health care workers younger than 35 years of age. This recommendation
is irrespective of duration of stay.
There are specific contraindications and adverse events associated with BCG
vaccine. A careful risk assessment should be made before administration and
specialist advice sought as appropriate.
Travellers who are in the risk groups described and who do not receive BCG
vaccine should be considered for pre-travel and post-travel testing for
exposure to tuberculosis.
Travellers who suspect that they may have been exposed to tuberculosis should
receive an appropriate medical evaluation.

country follows Public Health England, Advisory_Committee_on_Malaria_Prevention
(ACMP)_guidelines.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - There is a high risk of malaria in Senegal.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Malaria is transmitted via the bite of an
      infected Anopheles mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during the hours from dusk to dawn.
** Risk management **
    * Awareness of risk - Risk depends on the specific location, season of
      travel, length of stay, activities and type of accommodation. Those at
      higher risk of malaria, or of severe complications from malaria, include
      pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly, and those
      visiting friends and relatives.
    * Bite prevention - Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance
      measures. Anopheles mosquitoes feed predominantly during the hours from
      dusk to dawn.
    * Chemoprophylaxis - No malaria prevention tablets are 100% effective.
      Taking malaria prevention tablets in combination with mosquito bite
      avoidance measures will give substantial protection against malaria.
          o Chloroquine resistance is widespread. The recommended
            chemoprophylaxis is mefloquine, doxycycline or atovaquone/
            proguanil.
    * Diagnosis - Travellers who develop a fever of 38Â°C [100Â°F] or higher more
      than one week after being in a malaria risk area, or who develop any
      symptoms suggestive of malaria within a year of return should seek
      immediate medical care.

*** DENGUE FEVER ***
Dengue is a systemic viral disease. A_map_showing_the_global_areas_at_risk_for
dengue_can_be_found_here_(85_KB_GIF)
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Dengue is known or has the potential to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Dengue is transmitted via the bite of an infected
      Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes feed predominantly
      during daylight hours and are most abundant in urban or peri-urban
      settings. All travellers to dengue areas are at risk.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures. Aedes mosquitoes
      feed predominantly during daylight hours.
    * There is no vaccination or medication to prevent dengue.
    * A previous dengue illness with one of the four dengue virus serotypes
      does not confer immunity to other virus serotypes.
    * Infection with a second dengue serotype may be a risk factor for the
      development of dengue haemorrhagic fever.

*** SCHISTOSOMIASIS ***
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic flatworm infection of the intestinal or urinary
system caused by one of several species of Schistosoma.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - According to World Health Organization (WHO), cases of schistosomiasis
      were reported in this country in 2012. See_map.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Schistosoma larvae are released from infected
      freshwater snails and penetrate intact skin toÂ establish infection
      (schistosomiasis). Travellers may be exposed to schistosoma during
      activities such as wading, swimming, bathing or washing clothes in fresh
      water streams, rivers or lakes.Â 
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid wading, swimming, or bathing in fresh water.
    * Swimming in chlorinated water or sea water is not a risk for
      schistosomiasis.
    * Topical application of insect repellent before exposure to water, or
      towel drying after accidental exposure to schistosomiasis are not
      reliable in preventing infection.
    * There is no vaccine or tablets to prevent schistosomiasis.
    * Travellers who may have been exposed to schistosomiasis should have a
      medicalÂ assessment.
