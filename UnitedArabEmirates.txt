*** HEPATITIS A ***
Hepatitis A is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver. A_map

** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - Hepatitis A is known or presumed to occur in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis A is transmitted through contaminated
      food and water. Those at higher risk include travellers visiting friends
      and relatives, long stay travellers, and those visiting areas of poor
      sanitation.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should practice strict food, water and personal hygiene
      precautions.
    * Vaccine should_be_givenAll_travellers_in_risk_categories_should_receive
      vaccine to travellers whose planned activities put them at risk (see
      above).
    * Because hepatitis A vaccine is well tolerated and affords long-lasting
      protection, it may_be_givenMost_travellers_at_low_risk,_consider_vaccine
      for_those_in_risk_categories to all previously unvaccinated travellers.
    * Vaccine should also be given to those with chronic liver disease or
      haemophilia, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and those at
      occupational risk.

*** HEPATITIS B ***
Hepatitis B is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver and may
lead to chronic complications.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      - In this country 2% or more of the population are known or presumed to
      be persistently infected with the hepatitis B virus (intermediate/high
      prevalence).
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Hepatitis B is transmitted via infected blood or
      bodily fluids.
** Risk management **
    *  Travellers should avoid contact with blood or bodily fluids. Where
      contact is unavoidable, appropriate protective precautions should be
      taken.
A sterile medical kit should be carried.
Vaccination should be considered for all adult and child travellers.
Vaccination is recommended for travellers at higher risk of exposure including
those who:
      - may have unprotected sex
      - may be directly exposed to blood or blood products through their
     occupation, such as healthcare professionals
      - are participating in contact sports
      - may be exposed to contaminated needles through injecting drug use,
     or as a result of accessing medical or dental care e.g. those with
     pre-existing medical conditions and those travelling for medical care
      - intend to undergo renal dialysis whilst overseas
      - are adopting children from the country
      - long stay travellers.

*** RABIES ***
Rabies is a neurological disease caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus.
** Risk assessment **
    * EpidemiologyInformation_on_the_occurrence_of_disease_within_this_country
      -  rabies may be present in this country; information is limited or
      unavailable.
    * Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in this country.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - transmission may occur following contact with the
      saliva from an infected animal, most often via a bite, scratch or lick to
      an open wound or mucous membrane. Rabies transmission may occur following
      contact with the saliva of an infected bat (via bites or scratches or
      saliva contact with mucous membranes). Bites from bats are frequently
      unrecognised.
      The risk of exposure to wild animals may be increased for those with
      certain occupations e.g. veterinarians and those undertaking certain
      trips e.g. camping, wildlife viewing.
      Children are at increased risk as they are less likely to avoid contact
      with animals and to report a bite, scratch or lick.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should avoid contact with wild animals and bats.
    * Pre-exposure vaccination could be considered for those at increased risk
      (see above).
    * Following a possible exposure, wounds should be thoroughly cleansed and
      an urgent local medical assessment sought, even if the wound appears
      trivial. Prompt post exposure treatment may be required.
    * Post-exposure management and advice on return to the UK should be in
      accordance with PHE_guidelines.
Suitable vaccine and immunoglobulins may be in short supply or unavailable in
some countries.

      - Tetanus bacteria are found worldwide.
    * ExposureInformation_on_the_mode_of_transmission_and_factors_that_may
      increase_disease_risk - Tetanus bacteria are present in soil and manure
      and may be introduced through open wounds such as a puncture wound, burn
      or scratch.
** Risk management **
    * Travellers should thoroughly clean all wounds and seek appropriate
      medical attention
    * Travellers should have completed a primary vaccination course according
      to the UK schedule.
